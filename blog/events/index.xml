&lt;p>We had the fantastic opportunity to present the neurodesk project in todayâ€™s ANZ ISMRM reproducibility workshop. The 50 participants across Australia got to see the first live demo of the project and I am glad everything worked out and ran smoothly ðŸ™‚&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will post the recordings as soon as they are available.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This week we attended the eResearch Australasia conference and gave a talk about our little hackathon project that started at the OHBM Brainhack 2020: &lt;a href="https://github.com/NeuroDesk/">https://github.com/NeuroDesk/&lt;/a>. In a nutshell, we are trying to make it a lot easier to use neuroimaging software packages with the help of containers. The feedback at the conference was super helpful and itâ€™s great to see that many people are interested in this project ðŸ™‚&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here the talk recording: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOgV4zLGXU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOgV4zLGXU&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
