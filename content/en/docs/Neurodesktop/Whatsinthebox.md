     The software available in neurodesktop
---

Neurodesktop comes with the essential software required for neuroimaging data analysis pre-installed. Each release is built with the most recent version of these packages available at the build date. Some example packages include:
* Visual Studio Code
* Emacs
* Gedit
* Vim
* Python
* Lua
* Git
* Lmod
* Nipype
* Rsync
* Singularity
* GraphVis
* Imagemagic
* Htop
* Firefox
* Nextcloud client
* OpenSSH client

The neurodesktop environment is built to be light and fast to download and start-up. A number of additional programs are therefore available to use in the container, and will be downloaded when they are first used. A list of these additional packages can be found [here](https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodesk/blob/master/cvmfs/log.txt)
