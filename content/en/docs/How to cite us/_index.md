  How should I cite the tools I am using and Neurodesk itself?
---

## Citing tools

We recommend to cite the tool you are using with the version number and the builddate, because this guarantees full reproducibility. You can find this information here: https://neurodesk.github.io/applications/. It's also very important to cite the paper of the tool you are using and you find this information in the README.m of each tool.

## Citing Neurodesk itself

Finally you can cite Neurodesk with its version and a link to our website. 

## Example

“TGV QSM (v1.0.0_20210629, Langkammer, C; Bredies, K; Poser, BA; Barth, M; Reishofer, G; Fan, AP; Bilgic, B; Fazekas, F; Mainero; C; Ropele, S. Fast Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping using 3D EPI and Total Generalized Variation. Neuroimage. 2015 May 1;111:622-30. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.02.041) was run in Neurodesk (v20220302, https://neurodesk.github.io/).”
