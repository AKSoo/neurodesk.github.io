  How should I cite the tools I am using and Neurodesk itself?

## Citing tools

We recommend to cite the tool you are using with the version number and the builddate, because this guarantees full reproducibility. You can find this information here: https://neurodesk.org/applications/. It's also very important to cite the paper of the tool you are using and you find this information in the README.m of each tool.

## Citing Neurodesk

Finally you can cite Neurodesk with its version and a link to our website. 

## Citing AEDAPT

If you used any EEG/MEG or electrophysiology tools, please link to the AEDAPT website: https://www.aedapt.net/
