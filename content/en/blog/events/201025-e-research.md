  E-research conference 2020
---

This week we attended the eResearch Australasia conference and gave a talk about our little hackathon project that started at the OHBM Brainhack 2020: https://github.com/NeuroDesk/. In a nutshell, we are trying to make it a lot easier to use neuroimaging software packages with the help of containers. The feedback at the conference was super helpful and itâ€™s great to see that many people are interested in this project ðŸ™‚
